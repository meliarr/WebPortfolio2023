Seeking a second term in 2020, Rep. Susan Ruiz, sought ways to connect with voters, donors, and volunteers digitally during the height of the pandemic. 

This would require a compelling website that would support the campaign's digital efforts. Meticulously considering SEO, Accessibility, and UX, I curated a design that not only showcased her progressive values but also celebrated the spirit of Kansas and its residents.

This website strategically showcases her personality and platform through copy and video, endorsements from respected organizations and individuals, collects volunteer signups and voter priorities, and provides an English to Spanish toggle function.

Through her website, Susan's campaign effectively expanded her digital presence, raised crucial campaign funds, increased volunteer signups, and effectively communicated her inspiring story and vision to voters. Thanks to her impactful online platform, Susan successfully secured her re-election in 2020 and again in 2022.
