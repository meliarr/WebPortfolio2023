<span class="text-[23px] font-light">I was a Kansas City Women in Technology volunteer from 2017 to 2021, where I became marketing director for their Coding & Cocktails program.</span>

This program invites women in the area to learn front-end fundamentals in a lively and supportive environment. After a hiatius from covid, Coding & Cocktails was able to provide in-person sessions again and wanted to enhance the experience for attendees.

I collaboared by creating this set of illustrations that could be used for digital marketing and stickers that participants would receive upon completing each of their different coding sessions.
