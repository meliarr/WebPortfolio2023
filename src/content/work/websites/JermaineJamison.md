Jermaine is a community leader and entrepreneur with a passion for giving back to his community. In his run for Lenexa City Council, he wanted a website that invited voters to learn more about him, his background, and his priorities. 

I designed and built a website that would highlight his leadership experience, his dedication to the city and a hub of resources for voters and other members of the community.

This website was designed in Adobe Illustrator and built in WordPress using Elementor to provide a seamless user experience for his campaign volunteers who would manage and add content to his site.
