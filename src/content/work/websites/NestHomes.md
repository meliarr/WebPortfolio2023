<span class="text-[23px] font-light">Working on fully custom websites is something I absolutely love. Recently, I had the chance to dive back into a project I'd tackled before â€“ a client's website that I already knew inside out. It was a real pleasure helping them give it a fresh new look.</span>

After receiving the Figma file from one of our web designers, I got to work by following the design and building the website as specified for desktop and mobile.

To make the design responsive, I built the components using Bootstrap, and built the photography collage designs using CSS Grid so I can rearrange the order of the elements based on screen size.

When the client has specific needs about the data they want to present in the front-end, I use JavaSript to define the logic based on the client's specifications. For example, displaying available homes, building custom filters, selecting featured images, to name a few.
